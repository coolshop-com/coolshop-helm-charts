# fastapi-helm-chart

A simple Coolshop Helm chart for deploying FastAPI applications in Kubernetes.

This chart is maintained by Coolshop and primarily for Coolshop. PRs are accepted, however, expect triage to be slow, and that features might be rejected if they do not fit into our needs for the chart.
